# trainScheduler
<b>Week 7</b>

In this project, it should be able to allow you to submit the following:
    
    * Train Name
    
    * Destination 
    
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    
    * Frequency -- in minutes
  
 This project will calculate when the next train will arrive and should be relative to the current time.

 Built this project with:
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>Bootstrap</li>
    <li>JQuery</li>
    <li>Javascript</li>
    <li>Firebase</li>
    <li>Moment.js</li>
    <li>Adobe photoshop</li>

-- This project is to design a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. 
This app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js and will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station. --
